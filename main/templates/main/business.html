		<h1> Our Mission: </h1>
			<p>We are committed to serving your California wine needs. We build long-lasting relationships with our customers by delivering products of exceptional quality through service with integrity. Every interaction is an opportunity to deliver outstanding service providing not only the wine our clients need, but industry expertise and market data to support you and your programs.</p>

		<h1>Winemaker Solutions:</h1>
			<p>Constellation Brands sells more than 54 million cases of wine each year. Not everyone can has such capacity, however. Of the approximately 11,500 wineries in the United States, 96 percent sold less than 50,000 cases per year, placing them into the small or medium-size category. *</p>

		<p>California Wine Classic’s owner, Robert Indelicato, worked with a number of small and medium sized wineries including starting his own! Because we’ve been in your shoes, we developed Winemaker Solutions as a resource to other wineries and winemakers. Time is a valuable resource, and while you’re busy managing your cellar, vineyards and business, we’re here to help fill the gaps.</p>

		<p>Winemaker Solutions works with other wineries as a source of California still and sparkling wine to meet your needs. Whether it’s a custom blend, packaging or lot size, we’re here to give you the individualized attention your project needs. We work with you to identify the objective and then match sources of wine to fit that specific need.<p>

		<p>Whether you’re looking to solve a short or long term problem, we’ll develop a solution that fits your budget, timeline and specifications.</p>

		<p>(*Information as of 2017 data)</p>

		<h1>Bottle to Order:</h1>
		<p>In 2016, California shipped 238 million cases of wine to the U.S., up 2 percent from the previous year. With more segments of the population requesting and drinking California wine, we’re here to connect the supply with an ever-increasing demand. 

		Bottle to Order works with distributors and importers as their direct source of California still and sparkling wines. We often outfit distributors and importers year after year, ensuring consistency in quality and style.

		Similar to our Winemaker Solutions program, we’re here to give you the individualized attention your project needs. Whether you’re looking to solve a short or long term problem, we’ll develop a solution that fits your budget, timeline and specifications.

		We create custom packaging projects, secure label approvals, source varietals, craft blends, deliver wines and more all according to your requirements. Let us develop solutions for you!</p>
